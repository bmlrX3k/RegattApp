# RegattApp : School Android Project (March 2022)

This is a school project developed in **March 2022**. It represents my **very first Android application**.

The app is designed to assist sailing regattas on Lake Annecy (France). Key features include:
* **Navigation:** A map of the lake with marked buoys and real-time GPS localization.
* **Weather:** Access to local weather conditions.
* **Race Courses:** Display of regatta routes entered manually, via QR code, or fetched from a remote server.
* **Boat Profiles:** Ability to save and store the specific sailboat model used.

## Disclaimer

* **Not for production:** The code is an example of a first discovery of the Android environment and is not intended for real-world use.
* **Legacy:** This repository is kept for archival purposes to track my learning progress.
